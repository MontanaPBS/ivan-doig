                <p class="about-content">A new documentary from Montana PBS and 4:08 Productions offers an intimate look at the life and work of Ivan Doig, the iconic Montana author whose novels and memoirs depict a rugged and authentic American West.
                
                Director/co-producer and Montana native Nic Davis (Enormous: The Gorge Story and founder of 4:08 Productions) had this to say about creating the documentary: “Ivan’s life—like his work—was filled with complexity, beauty, hardship and hard work. This film aims to capture these elements, while weaving in what Doig called ‘the poetry under the prose.' We hope it honors the legacy it left behind.” </p>

                <p class="film-maker-content">Montana PBS producer Breanna McCabe draws from 16 years of video storytelling throughout the West and beyond. She is eager to bring “Higgins Ridge” to audiences in 2023, a historical story that’s grounded at the Missoula Smokejumper Base in McCabe’s hometown. She remembers watching smokejumpers practice landing on the hill behind her childhood home, and today she enjoys hearing “silk stories” from her brother-in-law, an Alaska smokejumper. As a producer at Montana PBS, McCabe contributes stories to the program “Backroads of Montana.” Her last documentary, “Ghost Forests,” took viewers into high elevations to examine the threats facing whitebark pine. McCabe graduated from the University of Montana School of Journalism in 2009, and returned to earn her master’s degree in environmental science and natural resource journalism in 2020. In between, McCabe worked as a broadcast news reporter for CBS News affiliates KPAX-TV in Missoula and KREM 2 News in Spokane. When she’s not asking senior smokejumpers to see their slide collections, she enjoys exploring trails, rivers and shores with her husband and their two pint-sized, high-spirited rescue dogs.
