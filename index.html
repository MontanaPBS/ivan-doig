            <h2 class="subheader airs">AIRS FEBRUARY 27 </h2>
            <p class="about-content">A new documentary from Montana PBS and 4:08 Productions offers an intimate look at
                the life and work of Ivan Doig, the iconic Montana author whose novels and memoirs depict a rugged and
                authentic American West.

                Director/co-producer and Montana native Nic Davis (Enormous: The Gorge Story and founder of 4:08
                Productions) had this to say about creating the documentary: “Ivan’s life—like his work—was filled with
                complexity, beauty, hardship and hard work. This film aims to capture these elements, while weaving in
                what Doig called ‘the poetry under the prose.' We hope it honors the legacy it left behind.” </p>
